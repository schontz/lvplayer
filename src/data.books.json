{"books":[{"id":"59","title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn","description":"<p><em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<\/em> (1884) by Mark Twain is one of the truly great American novels, beloved by children, adults, and literary critics alike.  The book tells the story of \u201cHuck\u201d Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer\u2019s sidekick in <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer<\/em>), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft.  Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.<\/p>\n<p>As Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures.  The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim.  A constant theme throughout the book is Huck\u2019s internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn\u2019t possibly be wrong to help him.<\/p>\n<p><em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<\/em> was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set.  Although the book was originally intended as a sequel to the children\u2019s book <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer<\/em>, as Twain wrote <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<\/em> it progressed into a more serious work.  Twain\u2019s views on slavery and other social issues of the time become clear through the words, thoughts, and actions of Huck Finn.  The book has always been the subject of great controversy, and according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ala.org\/bbooks\/100-most-frequently-challenged-books-1990\u20131999\" target=\"_blank\">The American Library Association<\/a> it was fifth on the list of most frequently challenged books in the 1990s.<br \/>(Summary by Annie Coleman)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/76","language":"English","copyright_year":"1884","num_sections":"47","url_rss":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/59","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/huck_finn_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn","url_librivox":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-by-mark-twain\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:42:07","totaltimesecs":38527,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}]},{"id":"141","title":"Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","description":"<p>\nCome and hear the strange tail of The Boss Hank Morgan, a modern day (at the time of publication) Connecticut Yankee who inexplicably finds himself transported to the court of the legendary King Arthur (as the title of the book implies). Hank, or simply, The Boss, as he comes to be most frequently known, quickly uses his modern day knowledge and education to pass himself off as a great magician, to get himself out of all sorts of surprising, (and frequently amusing) situations, as well as to advance the technological and cultural status of the nation in which he finds himself.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn the rather un-subtle sub-text of the story, Twain uses The Boss to express a surprisingly pragmatic and frequently contradictory philosophy. The Boss explores the relative merits of Democracy, and Monarchy, he expresses his views on the \u201cNature v. Nurture\u201d debate, he frequently speaks forcefully against an established Church, but just as strongly advocates for religion and a variety of churches (just not a compulsory one) and he devotes at least one afternoon to introducing his companions to the concept of inflation. In a far more subtle, yet no less forceful manner, the Boss shares with the reader some views about taxation, slavery (both literal and wage slavery), trade unions, the origins of the German language, the nature of marriage, and probably most powerfully, death.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIt is a tall order for a relatively brief text, but Twain manages it all with surprising clarity. No one will agree fully with the Boss on all of these matters, and I would be surprised if Twain himself would. In fact the Boss\u2019s views are so pragmatic, and often contradictory, the reader is left to wonder if Twain himself is alternately speaking through the Boss, and setting him up as a straw man. Either way it is a delightful story and a great piece of American Literature, to say nothing of an excellent argument for education.\n<br \/>\n(Review written by Steve Andersen)\n<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/86","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"45","url_rss":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/141","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/connecticutyankee_librivox\/connecticutyankee_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur's_Court","url_librivox":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/a-connecticut-yankee-in-king-arthurs-court-by-mark-twain\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"13:42:35","totaltimesecs":49355,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}]},{"id":"160","title":"Chapters from my Autobiography","description":"Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) began writing his autobiography long before the 1906 publications of these Chapters from my Autobiography.

The book, set in 1547, tells the story of two young boys who are identical in appearance: Tom Canty, a pauper who lives with his abusive father in Offal Court, London, and Prince Edward son of Henry VIII of England.  Due to a series of circumstances, the boys accidentally replace each other, and much of the humor in the book originates in the two boys' inability to function in the world that is so familiar to the other (although Tom soon displays considerable wisdom in his decisions). In many ways, the book is a social satire, particularly compelling in its condemnation of the inequality that existed between the classes in Tudor England. In that sense, Twain abandoned the wry Midwestern style for which he was best known and adopts a style reminiscent of Charles Dickens.

Twain wrote at the beginning of the essay: 'In one place in Deerslayer, and in the restricted space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offenses against literary art out of a possible 115. It breaks the record.' Twain listed 19 rules 'governing literary art in domain of romantic fiction', 18 of which Cooper violates in The Deerslayer.

It was first published in the 1905 Christmas issue of the magazine Harper's Bazaar, and in book format in June 1906 by Harper and Brothers publishing house. It is written in the style of a diary kept by the first woman in the Judeao-Christian creation myth, Eve, and is claimed to be \"translated from the original MS.\" The \"plot\" of this novel is the first-person account of Eve from her creation up to her burial by, her mate, Adam, including meeting and getting to know Adam, and exploring the world around her, Eden. The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden. It is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story of Adam and Eve, including 'Extracts from Adam's Diary,' 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.' Eve's Diary has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love. The book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wife Olivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written. Mark Twain is quoted as saying, \"Eve's Diary is finished \u2014 I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more.\" The story ends with Adam's speaking at Eve's grave, \"Wherever she was, there was Eden.\" (Introduction by Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/8525\/8525-h\/8525-h.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"1","url_rss":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4089","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/eves_diary_1003_librivox\/eves_diary_1003_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/eves-diary-by-mark-twain-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:40:07","totaltimesecs":2407,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}]},{"id":"4097","title":"Gilded Age, A Tale of Today","description":"<p><i>The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today<\/i> is an 1873 novel by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner that satirizes greed and political corruption in post-Civil War America. The term <i>gilded age<\/i>, commonly given to the era, comes from the title of this book. Twain and Warner got the name from Shakespeare's King John (1595): \"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily... is wasteful and ridiculous excess.\" Gilding a lily, which is already beautiful and not in need of further adornment, is excessive and wasteful, characteristics of the age Twain and Warner wrote about in their novel. Another interpretation of the title, of course, is the contrast between an ideal \"Golden Age,\" and a less worthy \"Gilded Age,\" as gilding is only a thin layer of gold over baser metal, so the title now takes on a pejorative meaning as to the novel's time, events and people.<br\/><br\/>\n\nAlthough not one of Twain's more well-known works, it has appeared in more than 100 editions since its original publication in 1873. Twain and Warner originally had planned to issue the novel with illustrations by Thomas Nast. The book is remarkable for two reasons\u2013-it is the only novel Twain wrote with a collaborator, and its title very quickly became synonymous with graft, materialism, and corruption in public life.

It consists of two stories - First Romance, which had originally appeared in The Express in 1870, and A Burlesque Autobiography (bearing no relationship to Twain's actual life), which first appeared in Twain's Memoranda contributions to the Galaxy. Rather, the content consists of a few short stories of fictional characters who are supposedly part of Twain's lineage. In the final passage, Twain develops the story to a point of crisis, and then abruptly ends the tale, saying:<br\/>\n\u201cThe truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) into such a particularly close place, that I do not see how I am ever going to get him (or her) out of it again\u2014and therefore I will wash my hands of the whole business, and leave that person to get out the best way that offers\u2014or else stay there.

Hoffman, and Jim Fisk.<br><br>The book was not one of Twain's personal favorites. Two years after publication, he bought all of the printing plates of the book and destroyed them.
